## **Developing a Web Application Frontend with Application Tracker System**

### **Description:**
This issue is aimed at beginners who want to gain experience in web development. The task involves creating a frontend for the "Application Tracker System" project, which includes features for users to upload job descriptions and their resumes. Use the existing python code to calculate the similarity score, helping users identify suitable job opportunities.

### **Background:**
The "Application Tracker System" project lacks a backend but enables users to upload job descriptions and resumes. The goal is to enhance the user experience by providing a web-based frontend that enables document uploading and similarity score calculation. The similarity score will help users determine the relevance of their application to a specific job opportunity.

### **Task:**
Your task is to develop a web application frontend for the "Application Tracker System" project. The frontend should incorporate the following functionalities:

1. **Document Upload:** Allow users to upload their resumes and job descriptions directly through the web interface. Implement a user-friendly file upload mechanism.

2. **Similarity Score Calculation:** Once the user uploads a job description and a resume, calculate a similarity score between the two documents. You can use text similarity algorithms such as Cosine Similarity or Jaccard Index to achieve this.

3. **Display Results:** Display the calculated similarity score to the user in a clear and understandable manner, such as a percentage or a numerical value.

4. **Styling and Responsiveness:** Ensure the frontend design is visually appealing and responsive, making it accessible and usable across various devices and screen sizes.

### **Guidelines:**
1. Utilize HTML for structuring the webpage, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic behavior.
2. Implement file upload functionality using HTML forms and JavaScript event handling.
3. Research and select an appropriate text similarity algorithm to calculate the similarity score between uploaded documents.
5. Provide visual feedback to users during the uploading and calculation processes.
6. Prioritize user experience by designing an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

### **Resources:**
- Documentation for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Text similarity algorithms (Cosine Similarity, Jaccard Index) and their implementation in JavaScript.
- Tutorials on handling file uploads in web applications.

### **Expected Output:**
A functional web application frontend for the "Application Tracker System," enabling users to upload job descriptions and resumes, calculate a similarity score between the documents, and display the score in an easily understandable format.
